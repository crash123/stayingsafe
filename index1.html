						<h2>Gaining an understanding</h2>
						<p>Being a teenager and going through puberty can be an emotional and trying time. As a teenager hair grows in places it wasn't before, voices deepen, genitals get bigger and girls start to become interesting. This section answers some of the "What is happening to my body?" or the "Is that normal?" questions you may have as a teenage male that you won't usually find in your average puberty book or resource. See the table below for some things that are normal but you may feel are out of the ordinary (click the image to get a bigger picture).</p>

					<p><span>How does it happen?</span></p>
					<p>Pregnancy occurs when the male sperm combines with a female egg to form a single cell in a process called fertilization. Fertilization occurs when a male ejaculates into a woman's vagina during sex, the sperm travel up the vagina and through the uterus to the fallopian tubes where they may attach to an egg. The fertilized egg then moves further down the fallopian tube until it reaches the uterus where it stays for 2-3 days until it attaches to the lining of the uterus which is when pregnancy begins. Over the next 42 weeks or 9 months the small mass of cells develops in the female's uterus into an infant human being. After approximately 9 months the woman gives birth to the child.</p>

					         <p>Although males cannot get pregnant and give birth themselves, they do have a responsibility   to any children they may help to make. In New Zealand if you do not live with the mother of the child then you have to pay child support to the child's caregiver. Child support is paid from until the child is born right up until their 19th birthday. To find out more about child support from the <a href="http://www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport/">New Zealand IRD click this link.</a></p>
					         <p>To prevent unplanned pregnancy, contraceptives such as, condoms can be used. To learn more about contraceptives see the 	section on this website called <a href="#article4" class="article">"How can I keep myself safe?"</a>
