						<h1>What's normal?</h1>
						<h2>Gaining an understanding</h2>
						<p>Being a teenager and going through puberty can be an emotional and trying time. As a teenager hair grows in places it wasn't before, voices deepen, genitals get bigger and girls start to become interesting. This section answers some of the "What is happening to my body?" or the "Is that normal?" questions you may have as a teenage male that you won't usually find in your average puberty book or resource. See the table below for some things that are normal but you may feel are out of the ordinary (click the image to get a bigger picture).</p>

							<p>Pearly penile papule</p>
						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Pearly penile papules are little dome shaped bumps that usually sit around the bottom and underneath the "knob" of the penis. They are fairly common and between 8% and 43% of all men have them. They are not due to sexual activity or poor hygiene   and you cannot spread them or have them spread to you. No treatment is necessary   and they become less obvious with age.</p>

							<p>Fordyce spots</p>
						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Fordyce spots are little spots on the shaft of the penis or on the female around the labia. About 80% to 95% of all adults (male and female) have them. They may appear as just one at a time or in groups of about 50 - 100. Fordyce spots are harmless and do not require any treatment, however, some fordyce spots do look similar to how some sexually transmitted infection (STIs) start off so if you are worried about them it essential to get a proper diagnosis from your doctor. While fordyce spots do not require any treatment you should avoid squeezing or picking them.</p>

							<p>Erections</p>
						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Erections occur when the soft spongy tissue in the shaft of the penis fills with blood causing it to harden or stiffen. Erections can be caused by physical stimulation or psychological stimulation or both. Impromptu erections are common during teenage years as hormones are all over the place, as you get older it will be easier to have more control over your erections.</p>

							<p>Wet dreams</p>
						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Wet dreams are a release of semen (the fluid that holds sperm) from your penis while you sleep. Wet dreams usually start during puberty when a hormone called testosterone starts being produced in large amounts. Most males have wet dreams, however, some don't. Some males can have just one wet dream and others can have multiple, both of which are normal. You may have less wet dreams once you start masturbating or having sex with a partner too.</p>

						<a href="images/fertilization.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Fertilization. The sperm coming in contact with the egg."><img src="images/thumbnails/fertilization_thumb.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Fertilization" /></a>
						<p>Pregnancy occurs when the male sperm combines with a female egg to form a single cell in a process called fertilization. Fertilization occurs when a male ejaculates into a woman's vagina during sex, the sperm travel up the vagina and through the uterus to the fallopian tubes where they may attach to an egg. The fertilized egg then moves further down the fallopian tube until it reaches the uterus where it stays for 2-3 days until it attaches to the lining of the uterus which is when pregnancy begins.Over the next 42 weeks or 9 months the small mass of cells develops in the female's uterus into an infant human being. After approximately 9 months the woman gives birth to the child.</p>

	                    <p>Although males cannot get pregnant and give birth themselves, they do have a responsibility   to any children they may help to make. In New Zealand if you do not live with the mother of the child then you have to pay child support to the child's caregiver. Child support is paid from until the child is born right up until their 19th birthday. To find out more about child support from the <a href="http://www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport/">New Zealand IRD click this link.</a></p>
	                    <p>To prevent unplanned pregnancy, contraceptives such as, condoms can be used. To learn more about contraceptives see the section on this website called <a href="#article4" class="article">"How can I keep myself safe?"</a>

						<h1>Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</h1>
					</div>
					<div id="demo" class="grid_12">
						<p>Sexually transmitted infections are caused by tiny bugs or viruses that are passed from person to person by sexual contact. Sexual contact does not just include vaginal sex; infections can also be passed around by oral and anal sex. Some sexually transmitted infections can be easily treated; however, some can last for life or even kill you. If you think you have a sexually transmitted infection it is best to go to your doctor or local sexual health clinic to have it looked at as soon as possible. In the table below are some of the more common sexually transmitted infections so you have a better idea of what to look out for, however, you should not try and diagnose yourself if you suspect you may have one, go and see a medical professional.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Pubic lice are small six legged insects that attach to hair in the pubic area (around the groin) and lay eggs. Pubic lice can also attach themselves to armpit hair and even eyelashes (see the photo). Pubic lice are usually spread by sexual contact with someone who already has them. Pubic lice cause itching which usually gets worse at night. They are easily treated with a special shampoo and combing to get rid of the eggs.</p>

							<p>Geintal Herpes</p>

						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection that is spread by skin contact with someone who already has the virus. Many people that get genital herpes never have any symptoms, however; some people do get painful blisters filled with a straw coloured liquid. The herpes virus does not go away and will stay with a person for life but also does not show symptoms for most of the time (the blisters). The best way to prevent yourself from getting herpes is to refrain from sexual contact or use condoms. While herpes cannot be cured, there are drugs that can be prescribed by a doctor to reduce or control the outbreaks of the blisters.</p>

							<p>Genital warts are a very common sexually transmitted infection, at least 75% of sexually active adults have come into contact with the virus (HPV) that causes genital warts. Usually genital warts do not hurt but most people find them to be uncomfortable and do not like the sight of them. They can be removed by a doctor or even go away by themselves, once they are removed the chance of spreading them becomes considerably less. The best barrier against genital warts is using a condom but condoms cannot prevent all skin contact and the virus still has a small chance of being transmitted.</p>

						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>HIV is one of the most deadly and serious sexually transmitted infections. HIV damages the immune system making it easier for you to get cancers and serious illnesses. When you have HIV and one of these serious illnesses you are said to then to have AIDS. With HIV most people get symptoms that resemble the flu but that is often missed. The easiest way to find out if you have HIV is to visit your doctor. HIV has no cure or vaccine, however, people with HIV can lead pretty normal lives by taking special drugs, which usually have to be taken for their entire life. The best way to protect yourself from HIV is to practice safe sex and use condoms and not share needles if you use drugs that require needle use.</p>
