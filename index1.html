						<h1>What's normal?</h1>
						<h2>Gaining an understanding</h2>
						<p>Being a teenager and going through puberty can be an emotional and trying time. As a teenager hair grows in places it wasn't before, voices deepen, genitals get bigger and girls start to become interesting. This section answers some of the "What is happening to my body?" or the "Is that normal?" questions you may have as a teenage male that you won't usually find in your average puberty book or resource. See the table below for some things that are normal but you may feel are out of the ordinary (click the image to get a bigger picture).</p>

							<p>Pearly penile papule</p>
						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Pearly penile papules are little dome shaped bumps that usually sit around the bottom and underneath the "knob" of the penis. They are fairly common and between 8% and 43% of all men have them. They are not due to sexual activity or poor hygiene   and you cannot spread them or have them spread to you. No treatment is necessary   and they become less obvious with age.</p>

							<p>Fordyce spots</p>
						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Fordyce spots are little spots on the shaft of the penis or on the female around the labia. About 80% to 95% of all adults (male and female) have them. They may appear as just one at a time or in groups of about 50 - 100. Fordyce spots are harmless and do not require any treatment, however, some fordyce spots do look similar to how some sexually transmitted infection (STIs) start off so if you are worried about them it essential to get a proper diagnosis from your doctor. While fordyce spots do not require any treatment you should avoid squeezing or picking them.</p>

							<p>Erections</p>
						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Erections occur when the soft spongy tissue in the shaft of the penis fills with blood causing it to harden or stiffen. Erections can be caused by physical stimulation or psychological stimulation or both. Impromptu erections are common during teenage years as hormones are all over the place, as you get older it will be easier to have more control over your erections.</p>

							<p>Wet dreams</p>
						</div>
						<div class="grid_3">
							<p>Wet dreams are a release of semen (the fluid that holds sperm) from your penis while you sleep. Wet dreams usually start during puberty when a hormone called testosterone starts being produced in large amounts. Most males have wet dreams, however, some don't. Some males can have just one wet dream and others can have multiple, both of which are normal. You may have less wet dreams once you start masturbating or having sex with a partner too.</p>

						<a href="images/fertilization.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Fertilization. The sperm coming in contact with the egg."><img src="images/thumbnails/fertilization_thumb.jpg" class="floatright" alt="Fertilization" /></a>
						<p>Pregnancy occurs when the male sperm combines with a female egg to form a single cell in a process called fertilization. Fertilization occurs when a male ejaculates into a woman's vagina during sex, the sperm travel up the vagina and through the uterus to the fallopian tubes where they may attach to an egg. The fertilized egg then moves further down the fallopian tube until it reaches the uterus where it stays for 2-3 days until it attaches to the lining of the uterus which is when pregnancy begins.Over the next 42 weeks or 9 months the small mass of cells develops in the female's uterus into an infant human being. After approximately 9 months the woman gives birth to the child.</p>

	                    <p>Although males cannot get pregnant and give birth themselves, they do have a responsibility   to any children they may help to make. In New Zealand if you do not live with the mother of the child then you have to pay child support to the child's caregiver. Child support is paid from until the child is born right up until their 19th birthday. To find out more about child support from the <a href="http://www.ird.govt.nz/childsupport/">New Zealand IRD click this link.</a></p>
	                    <p>To prevent unplanned pregnancy, contraceptives such as, condoms can be used. To learn more about contraceptives see the section on this website called <a href="#article4" class="article">"How can I keep myself safe?"</a>
