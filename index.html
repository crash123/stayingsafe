As a teenager hair grows in places it wasn't before, voices deepen, genitals get bigger and girls start to become interesting. This section answers some of the "What is happening to my body?" or the "Is that normal?" questions you may have as a teenage male that you won't usually find in your average puberty book or resource.

About 80% to 95% of all adults (male and female) have them. They may appear as just one at a time or in groups of about 50 - 100. Fordyce spots are harmless and do not require any treatment, however, some fordyce spots do look similar to how some sexually transmitted infection (STIs) start off so if you are worried about them it essential to get a proper diagnosis from your doctor. While fordyce spots do not require any treatment you should avoid squeezing or picking them. 										                                    </td>

                                  Erections can be caused by physical stimulation or psychological stimulation or both. Impromptu erections are common during teenage years as hormones are all over the place, as you get older it will be easier to have more control over your erections.

Wet dreams usually start during puberty when a hormone called testosterone starts being produced in large amounts. Most males have wet dreams, however, some don't.

                    <p>Pregnancy occurs when the male sperm combines with a female egg to form a single cell in a process called fertilization. Fertilization occurs when a male ejaculates into a woman's vagina during sex, the sperm travel up the vagina and through the uterus to the fallopian tubes where they may attach to an egg. The fertilized egg then moves further down the fallopian tube until it reaches the uterus where it stays for 2-3 days until it attaches to the lining of the uterus which is when pregnancy begins.</p>

                    <p>Over the next 42 weeks or 9 months the small mass of cells develops in the female's uterus into an infant human being. After approximately 9 months the woman gives birth to the child.</p>

                    <p>Although males cannot get pregnant and give birth themselves, they do have a responsibility   to any children they may help to make. In New Zealand if you do not live with the mother of the child then you have to pay child support to the child's caregiver. Child support is paid from until the child is born right up until their 19th birthday.

                    <p>Sexually transmitted infections are caused by tiny bugs or viruses that are passed from person to person by sexual contact. Sexual contact does not just include vaginal sex; infections can also be passed around by oral and anal sex. Some sexually transmitted infections can be easily treated; however, some can last for life or even kill you. If you think you have a sexually transmitted infection it is best to go to your doctor or local sexual health clinic to have it looked at as soon as possible. In the table below are some of the more common sexually transmitted infections so you have a better idea of what to look out for, however, you should not try and diagnose yourself if you suspect you may have one, go and see a medical professional.</p>

Many people that get genital herpes never have any symptoms, however; some people do get painful blisters filled with a straw coloured liquid. The herpes virus does not go away and will stay with a person for life but also does not show symptoms for most of the time (the blisters). The best way to prevent yourself from getting herpes is to refrain from sexual contact or use condoms. While herpes cannot be cured, there are drugs that can be prescribed by a doctor to reduce or control the outbreaks of the blisters.</td>

The best barrier against genital warts is using a condom but condoms cannot prevent all skin contact and the virus still has a small chance of being transmitted.<td><a href="images/genital_warts.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Genital warts on the penis."><img src="images/thumbnails/genital_warts_thumb.jpeg" alt="Genital warts" /></a>

                    <p>It is reasonably easy to prevent sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies, as a guy there are a number of things you can do to keep yourself safe. In this section a couple of methods are discussed in relation to keeping yourself safe.</p>

                    <h4>Condoms</h4>
                    <p>Condoms are one of the easiest and cheapest ways of keeping yourself safe. Condoms act as a barrier between the penis and the vagina or the penis and the anus. Condoms prevent the semen and sperm from entering the anus and vagina by creating a barrier. Condoms also help to prevent skin from touching during sex, helping to protect against sexually transmitted infections such as herpes and genital warts. </p>
                    <p>It is generally pretty easy to get a hold of condoms and services like sexual health clinics, family planning, school nurses and even your doctor can give them to you for free. It is also possible to get condoms reasonably cheaply from your local supermarket, pharmacy and dairy. To see how to put on a condom see the video below.</p>
