						<h1>What's normal?</h1>
						<h2>gaining an understanding</h2>
						<p>Being a teenager and going through puberty can be an emotional and trying time. As a teenager hair grows in places it wasn't before, voices deepen, genitals get bigger and girls start to become interesting. This section answers some of the "What is happening to my body?" or the "Is that normal?" questions you may have as a teenage male that you won't usually find in your average puberty book or resource. See the table below for some things that are normal but you may feel are out of the ordinary (click the image to get a bigger picture).</p>
